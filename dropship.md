> Dropship is a simple bot designed to streamline the process of starting/finding a game of Among Us by sending game codes across servers. All you have to do is connect a channel in your server and codes will be sent in it!

## [the idea](#the-idea)
During the pandemic is when I started coding in Discord.py. I had been searching for a bot idea... something that was strong yet simple to be my first bot. While playing Among Us (something I had also done a lot during the pandemic) I noticed how long it took to start a game all by yourself. And so, I came up with the idea of Dropship
